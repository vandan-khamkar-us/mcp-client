# Mcp Client demo using Agents

A minimal example showing an `Agent` as an MCP Client.

## Instructions

First, start an MCP server. A simple example can be found in `examples/mcp`, which already has valid binding setup.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Tap "O + enter" to open the front end. It should list out all the tools, prompts, and resources available.
